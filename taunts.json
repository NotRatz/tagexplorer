 "Your browser history says more about you than your resume ever will.",
 "You're one click away from total humiliation.",
 "Are you even in control anymore? Doubtful.",

 "You love being exposed, don't you?",
 "Every click is another confession.",
 "You'd do anything for a little attention, wouldn't you?",

 "You're addicted to this shame.",
 "You'd do anything for a little humiliation."]
